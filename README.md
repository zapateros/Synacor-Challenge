After completing Advent of Code 2018, I was looking for the next challenge when I stumbled upon the Synacor Challenge (https://challenge.synacor.com/). **If you don't want to see spoilers, you should now stop reading!** Basically what you have to do is create a virtual machine capable of running the included binary file. It starts out with implementing pretty basic Opcodes and it's not until you make your first mistake when you see the first signs of the true ingenuity of this challenge. The binary file talks back! Okay, no, it just gives hints about what you did wrong, but in a smart way. In total you have find eight codes to complete the challenge. Some of which are earned after just following steps and some are earned after solving some nice puzzles. And then there is this one code which is earned, only after losing a couple of nights sleep and gaining some grey hairs: code seven.
